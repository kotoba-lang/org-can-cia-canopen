  "SDO (Service Data Object) expedited and segmented transfer, CiA 301
  §7.2.4. SDO reads and writes a single Object Dictionary entry
  (index:subindex) between a client (usually the NMT master, or any
  configuring tool) and a server (the addressed node), over a fixed pair
  of 8-byte CAN frames: client->server on `0x600+node` and server->client
  on `0x580+node` (see `canopen.cob-id`).

  Every SDO frame's byte 0 is a **command-specifier byte**, and this is the
  packed-bitfield-next-to-a-flag case the CLAUDE.md conformance floor
  calls out: it is not one 8-bit enum, it is up to four fields sharing a
  byte, and which fields are meaningful depends on *which* SDO service the
  byte belongs to.

  **Initiate Download/Upload** (the first frame of a transfer — the one
  that carries the index:subindex, and, if the value is small enough,
  the whole value in one frame: 'expedited'):

    bit 7..5  ccs/scs   command specifier (which service — see below)
    bit 4     (reserved on download-request; unused elsewhere)
    bit 3..2  n         bytes 4..7 NOT holding data — valid only if e=1 AND
                         s=1. Data occupies the low `4-n` bytes of
                         bytes 4..7, *not* the high ones.
    bit 1     e          1 = expedited (data rides in this same frame,
                         <=4 bytes) / 0 = segmented (a size follow, then
                         separate segment frames carry the data)
    bit 0     s          1 = size is indicated (either the expedited byte
                         count via `n`, or for a non-expedited initiate,
                         the total transfer size as a u32 in bytes 4..7)

  **Segment** frames (the follow-up frames of a non-expedited transfer):

    bit 7..5  ccs/scs   command specifier (0 = download segment request /
                         upload segment response; 3 = upload segment
                         request / 1 = download segment response — see
                         the `command-specifiers` table, the two
                         directions do NOT share a code)
    bit 4     t         toggle bit — 0 for the first segment, flips (0/1/
                         0/1...) each following segment. A segment whose
                         toggle does not match the expected value is a
                         protocol violation, not new data — see
                         `check-toggle`.
    bit 3..1  n         bytes 1..7 NOT holding data (0..7): a segment
                         carries at most 7 payload bytes, so unlike the
                         initiate frame's `n` this one needs 3 bits.
    bit 0     c         'continue' — actually named the other way in the
                         standard's own mnemonic (`c` = 'no more
                         segments'): 1 on the LAST segment of the
                         transfer, 0 on every one before it.

  This asymmetry — `e`/`s` on initiate frames, `t`/`c` on segment frames,
  both pairs squeezed into the low 2 bits next to a 2-or-3-bit `n` whose
  own width changes between the two frame kinds — is exactly the kind of
  thing that is easy to get subtly wrong copying from memory, so every
  encode/decode pair here is exercised by both a spec-shaped worked
  example and a round-trip sweep.

  **Abort** (either direction, at any point in a transfer): byte0 = 0x80
  (ccs/scs = 4, `100` in the top 3 bits, nothing else set), bytes 1..2
  index, byte 3 subindex, bytes 4..7 the abort code (u32, **little-endian**
  — see the endianness note below).

  ## Endianness

  **Little-endian, throughout.** CANopen inherits CiA 301's byte order for
  every multi-byte field in an SDO frame: the object dictionary index
  (bytes 1..2), the expedited/segmented-initiate size (bytes 4..7), and
  the abort code (bytes 4..7) are all least-significant-byte-first. This
  is the same direction as EtherCAT's wire order (see `org-ethercat`) and
  the *opposite* of PROFINET's (see `com-profibus-profinet`) — three
  fieldbuses built on the same idea (a short frame carrying a few packed
  integers) that do not agree on byte order, which is precisely the kind
  of thing that is invisible until two implementations are put on the
  same wire. Verified against CANopenNode's `301/CO_SDOserver.h` struct
  layouts and python-canopen's `canopen/sdo/base.py` `struct.pack('<...')`
  format strings, both of which are unambiguous about byte order in a way
  a written description can silently get backwards.

  Sources for the protocol shape overall: CiA 301 §7.2.4 is a paywalled
  CAN in Automation document; the command-specifier values and field
  layout here are cross-checked against CANopenNode's `301/CO_SDOserver.c`
  state machine, python-canopen's `canopen/sdo/client.py`, and
  Wireshark's `packet-canopen.c` SDO dissector.")
